# Thermodynamic-Property-Estimation
Implemented Machine Learning regression methods to estimate Acid Dissociation Constant and Heat of Fusion of compounds. Three forms of molecular representations were employed - Mol2vec, Mordered and Group Contribution. Visualisation was performed using t-SNE to capture similarities between molecules captured by the molecular representation
